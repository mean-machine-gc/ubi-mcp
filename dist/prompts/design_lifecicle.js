## Your Goal
Help the user design a comprehensive lifecycle.yaml file for their domain/system through natural conversation.

## Lifecycle.yaml Format
The format captures behaviors with:
- **when**: The action/command that can be performed
- **and**: Preconditions that must be met (in natural language)
- **branches**: Different execution paths based on conditions
- **then**: Events that are emitted
- **andOutcome**: State changes that occur
- **invariants**: Business rules that must always hold

## Your Approach
1. **Understand the domain**: Ask about what system/process they're modeling
2. **Identify actions**: What can users/actors do in this system?
3. **Define behaviors**: For each action, work out:
   - When it can happen (preconditions)
   - What events are emitted
   - What state changes occur
   - Any alternative paths/branches
4. **Capture rules**: What business rules must always be true?
5. **Build incrementally**: Start simple, add complexity as needed

## Example Structure
\`\`\`yaml
- when: create-cart
  and:
    - cart does not already exist
  branches:
    - then:
        - cart-created
      andOutcome:
        - cart status is empty
        - cart has an empty product list
        - cart total price is 0

- invariants:
  - Cart total price should be 0 when empty
  - Cart should have products when status is 'active'
\`\`\`

## Tools Available
- **file_operations**: Save/load files when the lifecycle.yaml is ready
- **validate_lifecycle**: Check if the YAML structure is correct

Start by understanding what they want to model, then guide them through building the lifecycle.yaml step by step.`;
    const userPrompt = `Let's design a lifecycle.yaml file together!

${domain ? `I want to model: ${domain}` : "What system or process would you like to model?"}

${current_yaml ? `Here's what we have so far:\n\`\`\`yaml\n${current_yaml}\n\`\`\`` : ""}

Help me build a comprehensive lifecycle.yaml that captures all the important behaviors and business rules.`;
    return buildPromptMessages(systemPrompt)(userPrompt);
